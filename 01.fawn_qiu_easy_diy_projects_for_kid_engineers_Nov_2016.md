I design engernertion projects for mid-school and high school students. 

After using material **that are** pretty unexpected.

My inspriton comes from ~~pxxx xx~~ **problems in my** daily life.

for example, one time I need the customer **to come into** the ecomican(动漫?) **convince**,

 but I don't want to spent to much money, so I made my own, with the light**-up crown** ~~praxxx~~ and skirt(裙子).

 Another time, I was divestated , 

because my favorite mobile game flapy bird was been  taking off the App Store. 

So I was faced ~~xxx~~**delemaent? that** neither nerver update my phone or nerver play flapy bird aigin.

So unhappy with both options. I did only thing that make sence to me.

 I make a physic version of flapy bird that can nerver by taken off the app store. 

So a few of my friends **were**also ~~pretty derived~~ **protidativedto?** the game and **I** invited them to ~~player~~**play** as well. 

And them telled me that It ~~is~~  **was** just as ~~informing~~ **infrurading** as the regional game. 

So I up**load** the demo **of this**project online 

and to my surprise, it ~~xxx~~**went variy** and over ~~xx people~~**tow millions views** in just a few days. 

and what's more interesting are people's commits, 

a lot of people want to make they own or ask me how i was made.

so this come comfired I xxxx… we can teache people engernerion.

So with the money make by ~~xxradio~~ ** the variy video** .

xxx**able to enroll** students in classroom all made xxx game in a box. 

All tougth ~~xx~~**it was pretty chanllgen** , them learn a lot of new conceptions of engernerion and programing.

And them all egel to learn so them can finish the gamge ~~alone~~**as well**.

So before  flapy bird box I ~~xx…~~ **had a ideal of using creative  engernertion projects**to teach students when I was teaching in the mid-school,

I will ask students to build ~~cowbird?~~ **robot** from standard technology ~~…~~**kit**, 

and I notice that a lot of ~~xxx~~**them** seem bord(枯燥), 

**then few of them started** ~~xx..~~  taking peace of paper and ~~….~~ **decorated** and more then get into it and became more interesting ~~xx~~**in the project**  .

So I started looking for ~~xx~~ **a more creativly**  intruduce ~~xx~~**technology**  to students .

So what I found was that ~~xx~~**most of technology kits xxx in school are ** looks a little intemelating. 

they all made ~~xxx~~ **made of placstic** that you can not customize. 

**on top? of that , them all very**expensive ~~…~~ **costing** hunrands  of dollars ~~….~~  **per kit, **

**so that**  a not affordable **for most**classroom burgets~~….~~**since I identified some thing,**   

I decided made something on my own.I started with paper and faberic, 

after all **we all play with those** …kids .. also pretty cheap and ~~xx~~**can be** found anywhere around the house .

And I prototai? where students can create a light preche?using fabric and googly eyes. 

all helping other in classroom and discussing the project, they were able to activate.

so because of success of this project, I continue to create more and more engernertion projects to challgen my students.

And I also started to bring this workshop outside school and into community.

And something really interesting happened.I noticed that a lot of people very divest into out workshops ,

and specifically women and minorities then I expected  in a traditional ,

Now take a look at this and major technology ,women make up only 19% technology woke foces
